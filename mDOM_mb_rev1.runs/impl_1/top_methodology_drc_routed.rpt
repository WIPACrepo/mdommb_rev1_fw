TIMING-24#1 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 26 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks clk_out1_lclk_adcclk_wiz and fmc_clk overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 28). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '6' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
